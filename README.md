# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project to predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers using classification algorithms.

## 📚 Dataset
The classic Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived based on features like:
- Age, gender, class, fare, embarked port, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ⚙️ ML Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering and visualization
3. Model training and testing
4. Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix

## 📈 Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 81.11%
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
